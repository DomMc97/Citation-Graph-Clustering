# Unsupervised Clustering of Citation Graph

## Overview
Project which expands on the third coursework of the Methods for Data Science module I took as part of my MSc Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.

In this task I conducted the unsupervised clustering of text documents with an associated citation graph. I used the the k-means and modularity maximisation methods to create the clusters. I aditionally investigated the underying graph which included the computation of the degree, betweeness and edge centralities.

## Data
The data used is the Cora data set where each sample in the dataset corresponds to a journal paper in some scientific discipline. The text in each paper has been summarised as a high-dimensional vector of p features, where each (binary) coordinate of the vector indicates the presence or absence of a particular word within the text of the paper. The size of the dictionary for this dataset is 1433 words.

The dataset contains N=2485 papers, and each paper is described by a p-dimensional vector of features (p=1433). This dataset is given as an $N \times p$ feature matrix, F.

We also have information about citations between papers. The citations define an undirected graph which is encoded through its $N \times N$ adjacency matrix, A.

## Features

The features notebook contains the K-means clustering of the feature matrix and an evaluation of the clusterings found.
