# Clustering of Citation Graph

Project which expands on the third coursework of the Methods for Data Science module I took as part of my MSc Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.

In this task I conducted the unsupervised clustering of text documents with an associated citation graph. I used the the k-means and modularity maximisation methods to create the clusters. I aditionally investigated the underying graph which included the computation of the degree, betweeness and edge centralities.
